# NFT Tip Jar - Remix Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet** installed in your browser
2. **Base Sepolia testnet ETH** for gas fees (get from [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-sepolia-faucet))
3. **Remix IDE** account (free at [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org))

## Step 1: Get Base Sepolia ETH

1. Go to [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-sepolia-faucet)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Request testnet ETH (you'll need ~0.01 ETH for deployment)

## Step 2: Add Base Sepolia to MetaMask

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the network dropdown (top of MetaMask)
3. Click "Add network"
4. Enter these details:
   - **Network Name**: Base Sepolia
   - **RPC URL**: `https://sepolia.base.org`
   - **Chain ID**: `84532`
   - **Currency Symbol**: `ETH`
   - **Block Explorer**: `https://sepolia.basescan.org`

## Step 3: Deploy Contract in Remix

### 3.1 Open Remix IDE
1. Go to [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. Create a new workspace called "tip-jar-nft"

### 3.2 Create Contract File
1. In the file explorer, create a new file called `TipJarNFT.sol`
2. Copy the entire contents from `G:\base-tip-jar\contracts\TipJarNFT.sol`
3. Paste it into the Remix editor

### 3.3 Install Dependencies
1. In the Solidity Compiler tab (left sidebar)
2. Make sure "Auto compile" is enabled
3. If you see errors about missing imports, click "Compile TipJarNFT.sol"
4. The OpenZeppelin contracts should auto-install

### 3.4 Deploy Contract
1. Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
2. Make sure "Injected Provider - MetaMask" is selected
3. Ensure your wallet is connected to Base Sepolia
4. In the "Contract" dropdown, select "TipJarNFT"
5. Click "Deploy"
6. MetaMask will pop up - confirm the transaction
7. Wait for deployment to complete

### 3.5 Get Contract Address
1. After deployment, you'll see your contract in the "Deployed Contracts" section
2. Click the copy icon next to the contract address
3. It will look like: `0xABC123...`

## Step 4: Update Environment Variables

1. Open `G:\base-tip-jar\.env.local`
2. Replace `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` with your actual contract address:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT=0xYourActualContractAddress
   ```

## Step 5: Test the Application

1. Open terminal in `G:\base-tip-jar`
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
4. Connect your wallet (make sure it's on Base Sepolia)
5. Try sending a small tip (0.001 ETH)
6. Check your wallet for the NFT receipt!

## Step 6: Verify Contract (Optional)

1. Go to [Base Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.basescan.org)
2. Search for your contract address
3. Click "Contract" tab
4. Click "Verify and Publish"
5. Select "Solidity (Single file)"
6. Copy your contract code and paste it
7. Set compiler version to `0.8.20+`
8. Click "Verify and Publish"

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds" error
- Make sure you have Base Sepolia ETH, not mainnet ETH
- Get more testnet ETH from the faucet

### "Contract not found" error
- Make sure you copied the contract address correctly
- Check that the contract deployed successfully in Remix

### "Transaction failed" error
- Make sure you're on Base Sepolia network
- Try increasing gas limit in MetaMask
- Check that you have enough ETH for gas

### NFT not appearing
- Wait a few minutes for the transaction to confirm
- Check your wallet's NFT section
- Look for "Tip Jar Receipt" collection

## Next Steps

Once everything works on Base Sepolia:

1. **Switch to Base Mainnet**:
   - Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ENV=mainnet` in `.env.local`
   - Deploy the same contract to Base mainnet
   - Update the contract address

2. **Customize the NFT**:
   - Edit the SVG generation in the contract
   - Add your own branding or colors
   - Redeploy with your changes

3. **Add Features**:
   - Tip leaderboard
   - Different NFT tiers based on tip amount
   - Withdrawal functionality for the owner

## Support

If you run into issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify your wallet is on the correct network
3. Make sure you have enough ETH for gas
4. Try refreshing the page and reconnecting your wallet
